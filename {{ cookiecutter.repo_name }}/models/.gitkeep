# Models Directory

This directory is for storing trained models, model predictions, or model summaries.

## Recommended Structure

- `trained/` - Trained model files (e.g., .pkl, .joblib, .h5)
- `predictions/` - Model predictions and outputs
- `summaries/` - Model performance reports and summaries
- `experiments/` - Experimental model variations

## Usage

Your training scripts in `scripts/` will save models here, and prediction scripts will load them from here.
